El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño is the “warm phase” of a larger phenomenon called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). La Niña, the “cool phase” of ENSO, is a pattern that describes the unusual cooling of the region’s surface waters.

El Niño has an impact on ocean temperatures, the speed and strength of ocean currents, the health of coastal fisheries, and local weather from Australia to South America and beyond. El Niño events occur irregularly at two- to seven-year intervals. However, El Niño is not a regular cycle, or predictable in the sense that ocean tides are. 

The 2015 El Niño may have had a significant impact on weather and climate, but that’s not all. Researchers are blaming El Niño for increased numbers of shark sightings on the West Coast. A recent study by the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), has confirmed that the worldwide shark attacks reached an all-time record high in 2015. Accordingly, the number of unprovoked shark attacks on humans around the world has increased to about 98. The previous record of 88 was set back in 2000.
